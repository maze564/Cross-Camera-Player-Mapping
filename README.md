# Cross-Camera-Player-Mapping
This project maps player IDs between Tacticam and Broadcast videos using YOLOv11 for detection and color features for matching. It helps track the same player across different camera angles by comparing appearance features and outputting ID mappings for consistent multi-view analysis.
